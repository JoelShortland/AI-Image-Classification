This was an assignment done as part of a university assignment (USYD SOFT4318) to implement different AI models for an image classification task. We used Python's Sklearn and Tensorflow libraries to implement CNN, MLP and RF algorithms to do this.

The aim of the study was to train Convolutional Neural Network, Multi-layer Perceptron and RandomForest algorithms to perform an image classification task on 11 different body organs (as 28x28 pixel images), while altering their hyperparameters to see what performs best. We used the results of which compare and
contrast the algorithms to determine what works best for image classification. Naturally, CNN's worked the best as they are well suited for image classification.
